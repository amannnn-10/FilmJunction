# Movie recommendation system

Welcome to the system for suggesting films! Based on user choices and movie data, this system is made to offer tailored movie suggestions. Our suggestion engine will assist you in finding films that suit your tastes, whether you're looking for the newest blockbuster, a vintage movie, or something in between.

The movies recommendation system is a localhost webpage that enables us to find all the films that are comparable to a particular film.

The TMDB5000 dataset, one of the greatest and most valuable datasets available, is the one that was retrieved from Kaggle.

This recommendation system helps us find up to 5 comparable films so that we can let viewers know what to watch next.
